emacs-config
============

Put all these files in directory $HOME/.emacs.d

If you gave an emacs init file in your HOME dir, set it away.

These config files are based on the Starter Kit package of Kieran Healy.

Mac specifics were removed, plus some other packages, esp the ones for statistical analysis...
but they can be re-instated easily.

Read starter-kit.org for more info.

rename the file xaos52.org to $USER.org
